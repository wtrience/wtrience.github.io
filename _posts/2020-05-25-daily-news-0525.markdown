# 汽车租赁公司赫兹申请破产保护_0525

Car rental company Hertz has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after the pandemic saw its business plummet.
The firm,which earns much of its income from car rentals at airports,said it had been affected by the sharp downturn in global travel.
The company - which began operating a century ago in chicago with a dozen Model T Ford cars - had already furloughed or laid off 200000 employees, or around half of its global workforce,in response to the pandemic.
